Finished Milestone 2 tomorrow. To do: 

1. Set up Doxygen

2. Start building dependency in App/. Maybe implement a simple root finding application.

3. Dual/AutoDiff implements multivariable features

Usefule resources that I find helpful about Dual numbers:

1. https://github.com/dtecta/motion-toolkit/blob/master/moto/Dual.hpp

2. https://github.com/tesch1/cxxduals

3. https://medium.com/@omaraflak/automatic-differentiation-4d26d03b7508
 
4. https://blog.demofox.org/2017/02/20/multivariable-dual-numbers-automatic-differentiation/

5. https://github.com/darioizzo/audi/blob/master/include/audi/gdual.hpp

Other to-do things (not urgent):

1. Broader Impact Statement

2. Think about different ways to break the code (corner cases) and maybe write more about this to provide better user experience
